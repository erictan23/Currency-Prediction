# Currency-Prediction

# Introduction
The objective of this project was to understand the trends of currency from the Kaggle Currency Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/weirdanalyst/currency-exchange-rates-since-2000-01-03). 
This project allowed me to enhance my data cleaning and preparation skills as well as time series modelling and predictive machine learning models.

# How to Set Up
1. Run the .ipynb notebook on any Jupyter notebook/IDE
2. Ensure that you

# Discussions
There are many possible reasons why a country's currency would increase or decrease such as:
- Interest Rates
- Inflation Rates
- Economic Performance
- Political Stability
- Trade Balance
- Market Speculation
- Government Intervention
- Commodity Price

With time, we wanted to discover if there are any time-related trends that would help us forecast the upcoming SGD Currency. 
However, the forecast analysis did not perform well with the ARIMA model utilising time trends. 
Hence, this project scope was shifted to see if other country's currency would be able to predict SGD currency.
